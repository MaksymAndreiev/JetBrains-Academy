  <p>Most programmers are used to googling an answer when they don't know how to do something or ask a question on a forum like <a target="_blank" href="https://stackoverflow.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">Stack Overflow</a>. Sometimes, on forums, you can come across such an abbreviation as <strong>RTFM</strong>. It has slightly different meanings, but we will focus on "Read the following manual". It speaks for itself, doesn't it? If you see such an answer, it means that the question could have been answered by reading the corresponding manual or documentation.</p> 
  <p><strong style="font-size: inherit;">Reading the documentation </strong>is, indeed, an essential skill for a programmer. To understand why it is so, let's consider several points:</p> 
  <ol> 
   <li>The official documentation is the most truthful and complete source.</li> 
   <li>It contains up-to-date information for the latest versions.</li> 
   <li>The same code can be written in different ways, but the documentation contains the best practices.</li> 
  </ol> 
  <p>These reasons should already be enough for you to open up to the documentation and hope that it will open up to you!</p> 
  <h2>Main source of documentation</h2> 
  <p>Of course, Python has its own complete and up-to-date <a target="_blank" href="https://docs.python.org/3/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">official documentation</a>! Let's take a look at the site header:</p> 
  <p><img alt="" height="119" src="https://ucarecdn.com/cc67294e-478a-4177-9b48-3f3e7f33031e/" width="956"></p> 
  <p>By default, we see the latest version of Python, but you can find documentation for older versions as well. For convenience, you can also select another available language or use the <em>Quick Search</em> field to find the information you need.</p> 
  <p>Below you can see <strong>parts of the documentation</strong>. Let's take a quick look at some that are important for us:</p> 
  <ul> 
   <li><strong><a target="_blank" href="https://docs.python.org/3.9/tutorial/index.html" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">Tutorial</a></strong> is the one to start with when discovering the Python world.</li> 
   <li><strong><a target="_blank" href="https://docs.python.org/3.9/library/index.html" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">Library Reference</a> </strong>is a more detailed information on how Python works and what features it has. In this section, you will spend most of your time as a Python programmer.</li> 
   <li><strong><a target="_blank" href="https://docs.python.org/3.9/using/index.html" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">Python Setup and Usage</a></strong> contains tips on how to install and configure Python environment on different platforms.</li> 
   <li><strong><a target="_blank" href="https://docs.python.org/3.9/howto/index.html" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">Python HOWTOs</a></strong> are various guides on specific topics.</li> 
  </ul> 
  <p>You can also download the documentation in a format convenient for you on the <a target="_blank" href="https://docs.python.org/3/download.html" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">download page</a>.</p> 
  <p>The docs contain a lot of information, but don't be afraid, you don't have to read everything at once. The main thing is to learn to find answers to your questions.</p> 
  <h2>Official Python documentation</h2> 
  <p>The best way to learn something is to try it yourself, so let's refer to the <a target="_blank" href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/math.html" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">documentation of the math module</a> as an example. We suggest that you open it and take a look at it yourself first. Below we describe what you can find there.</p> 
  <p>First of all, documentation tells us what a particular module is used for:</p> 
  <pre><code class="language-no-highlight">This module provides access to the mathematical functions defined by the C standard.</code></pre> 
  <p>And also about various restrictions:</p> 
  <pre><code class="language-no-highlight">These functions cannot be used with complex numbers...</code></pre> 
  <p>For each function from this module, you can find a description of what it does and what value you get as a result. Consider the <a target="_blank" href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/math.html#math.fabs" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">math.fabs(x)</a> function:</p> 
  <p><img alt="" height="50" src="https://ucarecdn.com/32e5d05f-e925-4740-b6cf-f91d04e99c43/" style="float: left;" width="273"></p> 
  <p> </p> 
  <p><br> Moreover, the documentation will indicate which errors we may encounter when calling the function with invalid arguments.</p> 
  <p>Also, there are often some sections that are specific to the module itself. In <code class="language-python">math</code>, for example, "<a target="_blank" href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/math.html#constants" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">Constants</a>" is such a section and it contains a list of all constant values defined in the module, as the one below:</p> 
  <p><img alt="" height="63" src="https://ucarecdn.com/881f715d-0ce1-42b0-ad7e-d26a923b3524/" width="515"></p> 
  <p>Finally, in the <strong>See also</strong> section at the very end you can find alternatives or additional information:</p> 
  <p><img alt="" height="77" src="https://ucarecdn.com/76fc598e-1db7-4cd0-b32d-e98367857574/" width="509"><br> </p>
  <div class="alert alert-primary">
   If you need to quickly find information about a specific module, function, and so on, use the page search in the browser (
   <strong>Ctrl + F, or ⌘ + F on Mac)</strong>
  </div>
  <p></p> 
  <h2>Documentation of third-party libraries</h2> 
  <p>In addition to the standard libraries that come with the default Python installation, there are also third-party libraries. They are developed by third-party programmers (hence the name) and serve a specific purpose. Therefore, another source of information that you will often come across is the documentation of third-party libraries. </p> 
  <p>Let's consider the documentation for one of such libraries — <a target="_blank" href="https://pypi.org/project/colorama/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">Colorama</a>, which "<em>makes ANSI escape character sequences (for producing colored terminal text and cursor positioning) work under MS Windows</em>". As we can see, just as the official documentation, it starts with a short description of what the library is used for.</p> 
  <p>Also, you will find information on how to install a third-party library:<br> <img alt="" height="131" src="https://ucarecdn.com/c8613ac5-b7e4-4d68-b002-8f01a52f4845/" width="627"><br> and examples of what you get as a result (<em>follow the link and see for yourself!</em>).</p> 
  <p>Then, the documentation will always contain examples of how to use the library in various cases illustrating its capabilities. We will not show it here, but you can see it yourself in the <a target="_blank" href="https://pypi.org/project/colorama/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">Colorama</a> documentation.</p> 
  <p>In order to get used to the documentation, you can familiarize yourself with its structure using examples of some other third-party libraries: <a target="_blank" href="https://matplotlib.org/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">Matplotlib</a>, <a target="_blank" href="https://docs.sympy.org/dev/index.html" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">SymPy</a>, <a target="_blank" href="https://pypi.org/project/prettytable/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">PrettyTable</a>, <a target="_blank" href="https://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">BeautifulSoup</a>. Not all of them may be clear to you yet, but it's okay! In programming, you often have to face new things. However, all of them usually consist of the same parts: a short summary of what the library is used for, installation guidelines, and a list of functions with descriptions and usage examples.</p> 
  <p></p>
  <div class="alert alert-primary">
   Note that documentation of third-party libraries is not always full and up-to-date. It is written by the developers themselves, so keep that in mind.
  </div>
  <p></p> 
  <h2>Some help()</h2> 
  <p>Often you need to get information while writing code, and Python has a built-in help system for such cases, allowing you to get a quick reference about an object. To do this, you need to call the <code class="language-python">help()</code> function and pass an object as an argument. For example, it can be a function:</p> 
  <pre><code class="language-python">help(len)

# Help on built-in function len in module builtins:
#
# len(obj, /)
#     Return the number of items in a container.</code></pre> 
  <p>Note that the function in such a case is written without parentheses.</p> 
  <p>Now, let's try to get brief documentation about the <code class="language-python">sqrt()</code> function from the <code class="language-python">math</code> module:</p> 
  <pre><code class="language-python"># something goes wrong:

help(math.sqrt)  # NameError: name 'math' is not defined</code></pre> 
  <p>The thing is, you should either import the module first:</p> 
  <pre><code class="language-python">import math


help(math.sqrt)

# sqrt(x, /)
#    Return the square root of x.</code></pre> 
  <p>or pass the name of the object in brackets like: <code class="language-python">help('math.sqrt')</code>.</p> 
  <p>All in all, it is a convenient method to get short info about the usage of an object without searching for its documentation on the Internet.</p> 
  <h2>Conclusion</h2> 
  <p>Remember that just reading the documentation from the beginning to the end will not turn you into a good programmer. The most important thing is practice, and practice makes perfect. Documentation is just an instrument, but still, it's important to know how to use it.</p> 
  <p>Hyperskill tries to answer all the questions it poses, but it also encourages learners to look for additional information outside the platform if they want to know more. Documentation is the first assistant in this matter. After this topic, we hope you are ready to search for some additional information in the documentation.</p>
