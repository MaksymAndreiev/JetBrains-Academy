<h2>Description</h2>

<p>Flask is a lightweight web application framework. It is designed for a quick start, and you can scale up your solutions to the level of complex applications if you want to. It is one of the most popular Python web application frameworks. The Flask framework allows you to start a web application from a single Python file.</p>

<h2>Theory</h2>

<p>Create a Flask application object to start working with it:</p>

<pre><code class="language-python">from flask import Flask

app = Flask(__name__)</code></pre>

<p>Pass <code class="language-python">__name__</code> to the constructor so that Flask knows where to look for templates, static files, and so on. For more information, have a look at the <a target="_blank" href="https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/1.1.x/api/#flask.Flask" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">Flask documentation</a>. We will talk about templates and static files in the next stages.</p>

<p>You are going to configure the project through this object; it allows you to create routes (views), a database, run the server, and so on.</p>

<p>We need to show Flask how to handle the incoming requests. Create a method and bind it to a URL.</p>

<pre><code class="language-python">@app.route('/')
def index():
    return 'Hi! This is the response from the Flask application'
</code></pre>

<p>If a user goes to the root URL, Flask will call the <code class="language-python">index</code> method and return the result of its execution. The name of the method should be unique for each route. You can add any other routes to your application:</p>

<pre><code class="language-python">@app.route('/profile')
def profile():
    return 'This is profile page'


@app.route('/login')
def log_in():
    return 'This is login page'</code></pre>

<p>You can learn more about routing in <a target="_blank" href="https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/1.1.x/quickstart/#routing" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">the Flask documentation</a>.</p>

<p>All you need to do is to run your application. Use the following construction to run a flask application:</p>

<pre><code class="language-python">if __name__ == '__main__':
    if len(sys.argv) &gt; 1:
        arg_host, arg_port = sys.argv[1].split(':')
        app.run(host=arg_host, port=arg_port)
    else:
        app.run()</code></pre>

<h2>Objectives</h2>

<p>Create a simple web application that handles the requests to the <code class="language-python">'/'</code><strong> </strong>URL and returns <code class="language-python">Hello, world!</code> as a response.</p>
